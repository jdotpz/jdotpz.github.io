Those may be hard to print, but thanks to Tanner from Mozilla Community IT, it is not at all hard to play [DevOps Against Humanity](http://www.devopsagainsthumanity.net/) with custom DevOps cards.  Simply start a game there and select the DevOps Against Humanity pack for your game.\n[Here is the open-for-editing-by-the-public list](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/devops-against-humanity) of suggested cards.","tags":["lol","games","cardsagainsthumanity","devopsagainsthumanity","devops"],"published":1401577463015,"updated":1401577720338}
