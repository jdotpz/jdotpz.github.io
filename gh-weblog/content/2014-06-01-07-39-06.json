A: *Tough to say*.\n* Does this application improve or worsen pictures? \n:: * **Answer**: *Based on the evidence I've seen, this application only worsens your pictures.*\n::   **However**, I'm basing this solely on two factors:  \n:: *    1-The suggestive naming of the application \n:: *    2-The image used for the logo which looks like it was designed on a 1994 CompUSA special that couldn't even run Leisure Suit Larry 2.\n\nWith those caveats, I cannot heartily recommend [Image Worsener](http://entropymine.com/imageworsener/).  However, with the unswayed belief that any press is good press, I know they will pull out of this slump.\n\n","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1401626346883,"updated":1401627196131}
