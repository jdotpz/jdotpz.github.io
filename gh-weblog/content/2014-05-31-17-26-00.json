{"title":"","author":"jdotpz","content":"#Introducing My First Node.JS App, http_helper\nRedirects have always been a thing I hated setting up, but instead of using S3 buckets or silly long apache2/nginx vhosts, I wanted an app that read a config file full of redirects / proxies based on incoming host headers and forwarded people to the right place with the right return code (301 or 302).\n\nThus, [**http_helper**](https://github.com/mozilla/http_helper) was born. (with the caring tender help of [Pomax](http://pomax.github.io) )\n\nGiven a .json config file listing out which hostnames should redirect to which pages, I now have infrastructure to replace all those silly vhosts and buckets.  I got even more out of hand when I added a ton of standard name dashboard redirects, such as:\n* http://traffic.webmaker.org\n* http://status.badgekit.org\n* http://performance.webmaker.org\n* http://status.opennews.org\n\nI need to fix a bug in it which causes a trailing slash to be added to redirects, but otherwise, it is pretty rad.","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1401575160791,"updated":1401575548861}
